# Tetris #
A simple ASCII clone of Tetris, minus the whole time aspect.

(You know, the bit that makes it fun)

### Usage ###
Clone repo (you can figure it out)
```sh
git clone https://bitbucket.org/BobMakingPie/tetris.git
```
Then run from command line/shell/terminal/whatever:
```sh
python main.py
```
(use `python3` if both 2.x and 3.x are installed)

### Memes ###
